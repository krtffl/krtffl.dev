        <p>i kind of already spoiled it but yeah, i studied physics. it wasn&rsquo;t enough so i decided to study chemistry as well. graduated from both simultaneously and eventually decided i didn&rsquo;t like those fields and i better switch to software engineering because it is common knowledge there is a bunch of girls doing software - haha, got you!</p>
<p>honestly it looked fun. it looked like software engineering never has enough of itself, and that resonates with me in some level. so yeah i took a bootcamp like everybody does with the difference i was actually somewhat good, so it got me a job - also a friend got me a job, he was actually the one that got it for me, but you know, it&rsquo;s nice to say it is because of the bootcamp anyway - so i started coding.</p>
<p>some aws, some serverless stuff, you know the drill. some javascript.</p>
<p>then i realized - as i was wearing a full head to toe adidas outfit - adidas had some headquarters in spain and i thought that might be cool. plus i thought i would surely get some nice discounts. got an interview for a minimum 3yoe (years of experience - you&rsquo;re welcome) position and turnt out i was good enough so they hired me up.</p>
<p>some more javascript, lots of agile, never ending doses of agile, some bureoucracy, some shoes. a decent amount of shoes. and shirts. and caps. and shorts. and then  breaking the whole product exchange service world wide for a weekend.</p>
<p>then i realized go (the programming language, this is not a verb here otherwise the sentence woulnd&rsquo;t have much sense) was pretty awesome. simpler than javascript. more performant than javascript. so just *<em>better</em> than javascript.</p>
<p>i tried to get something going within the company but you know, germans, plus it&rsquo;s a freakingly huge company, so nothing came out of that. and hey, the best way to learn something is to just throw yourself head first into a wall till you get into the platform 9 3/4.</p>
<p>so i found about dorna searching for a backend. yeah dorna, the one that rules moto gp. and they used go. we use go, actually. sorry for the spoiler again. but yeah they trusted me, though i could pick the language fast enough so that i could help them up, and that&rsquo;s the end of the story so far.</p>
