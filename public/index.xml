      <description>&lt;p&gt;well, it was about time to start writing some code in this - supposedly - blog that shows how i become a 10x engineer. one might start to think the fastest approach to do it is to stop writing code. no way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this is probably the post that makes the least sense of all but i still need to get some practice before i get into business and dive deep into the technicalities so here it is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i kind of already spoiled it but yeah, i studied physics. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough so i decided to study chemistry as well. graduated from both simultaneously and eventually decided i didn&amp;rsquo;t like those fields and i better switch to software engineering obecause it is common knowledge there is a bunch of girls doing software - haha, got you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;honestly it looked fun. it looked like software engineering never has enough of itself, and that resonates with me on some level. so yeah i took a bootcamp like everybody does with the difference i was actually somewhat good, so it got me a job - also a friend got me a job, he was actually the one that got it for me, but you know, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to say it is because of the bootcamp anyway - so i started coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
