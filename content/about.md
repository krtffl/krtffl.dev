i kind of already spoiled it but yeah, i studied physics. it wasn't enough so i decided to study chemistry as well. graduated from both simultaneously and eventually decided i didn't like those fields and i better switch to software engineering obecause it is common knowledge there is a bunch of girls doing software - haha, got you! 

honestly it looked fun. it looked like software engineering never has enough of itself, and that resonates with me on some level. so yeah i took a bootcamp like everybody does with the difference i was actually somewhat good, so it got me a job - also a friend got me a job, he was actually the one that got it for me, but you know, it's nice to say it is because of the bootcamp anyway - so i started coding.

some aws, some serverless stuff, you know the drill. some javascript.

then i realized - as i was wearing a full head to toe adidas outfit - adidas had some headquarters in spain and i thought that might be cool. plus i thought i would surely get some nice discounts. got an interview for a minimum 3yoe (years of experience - you're welcome) position and turned out i was good enough with less than a year in the industry so they hired me up.

some more javascript, lots of agile, never ending doses of agile, some bureaucracy, some shoes. a decent amount of shoes. and shirts. and caps. and shorts. and then  breaking the whole product exchange service worldwide for a weekend. 

then i realized go (the programming language, this is not a verb here otherwise the sentence woulnd't have much sense) was pretty awesome. simpler than javascript. more performant than javascript. so just **better** than javascript.

i tried to get something going within the company but you know, germans, plus it's a freakingly huge company, so nothing came out of that. and hey, the best way to learn something is to just throw yourself head first into a wall till you get into the platform 9 3/4.o

so i found out about dorna searching for a backend. yeah dorna, the one that rules moto gp. and they used go. we use go, actually. sorry for the spoiler again. but yeah they trusted me, thought i could pick the language fast enough so that i could help them up, and that's the end of the story so far.
