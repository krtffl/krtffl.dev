a door into my engineering journey ???

it might come as a joke but: a physicist, a chemist and a software engineer walk into a bar. what do they do?

turns out all three are me and what they do is start an engineering blog at the height of blogging in the middle of 2024. 

definitely i look like a loser. hey, i'm willing to take that. it has an explanation though so bear with me: 

i never have enough and i know for certain i want to **build** my own stuff. you know. my company. my product. my team. it is not easy, i know, so what? that makes it all the fun. anyway i have realized that before getting to that, i need to build a platform for my character, so why not just gather the whole journey in a blog? the good thing is nobody has to read it for it to be considered as a platform - i guess, right?

whatever, thanks for stopping by
